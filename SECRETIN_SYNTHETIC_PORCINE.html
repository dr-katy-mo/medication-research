# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>SECRETIN SYNTHETIC PORCINE</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Secretin is a naturally occurring hormone originally discovered in 1902 by Bayliss and Starling in the duodenal mucosa. It is naturally produced by specialized enteroendocrine cells (S cells) located in the duodenum and jejunum of all mammals, including humans. The synthetic porcine version is manufactured to replicate the structure and function of endogenous secretin, with porcine secretin differing from human secretin by only 2 amino acids in the 27-amino acid sequence. Secretin was historically extracted from porcine duodenal tissue before synthetic production methods were developed. No traditional medicine use is documented, as it was discovered through modern physiological research.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
Secretin is a 27-amino acid peptide hormone that is virtually identical across mammalian species. The synthetic porcine version maintains the same peptide structure as naturally occurring secretin, with amino acid differences at positions 14 (serine vs. asparagine) and 16 (lysine vs. arginine) compared to human secretin. These minimal differences do not significantly alter biological activity. The molecule belongs to the secretin/glucagon/VIP family of peptide hormones and shares structural homology with other naturally occurring regulatory peptides including glucagon, GIP, and VIP.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
Secretin functions through the secretin receptor (SCTR), a naturally occurring G-protein coupled receptor found in pancreatic ductal cells, hepatocytes, gastric parietal cells, and other tissues. Upon binding, it activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cyclic AMP levels and triggering physiological responses including pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, bile flow stimulation, and gastric acid inhibition. This mechanism directly replicates the endogenous secretin signaling pathway that maintains digestive homeostasis.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
Secretin synthetic porcine targets the naturally occurring secretin receptor system that evolved to regulate digestive enzyme secretion and pH balance. It restores normal pancreatic exocrine function by supplementing deficient endogenous secretin activity, enabling natural digestive processes to proceed. The medication works within the evolutionarily conserved entero-pancreatic axis that maintains digestive homeostasis. By stimulating physiological pancreatic bicarbonate and enzyme secretion, it facilitates the body's natural digestive mechanisms rather than replacing them. This can prevent the need for more invasive interventions like surgical procedures or parenteral nutrition in cases of severe pancreatic insufficiency.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
Secretin synthetic porcine binds to secretin receptors primarily located on pancreatic ductal cells, activating the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. This stimulates bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice secretion, neutralizes gastric acid entering the duodenum, and optimizes pH for pancreatic enzyme activity. It also stimulates bile secretion from hepatocytes and inhibits gastric acid production, coordinating the integrated digestive response that occurs naturally after meals.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Primary therapeutic applications include pancreatic function testing (secretin stimulation test), diagnosis of gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. It serves as a diagnostic tool to assess pancreatic ductal cell responsiveness and bicarbonate secretory capacity. The medication has a favorable safety profile with minimal adverse effects, typically used for short-term diagnostic procedures rather than chronic therapy. Contraindications are limited, primarily including hypersensitivity reactions.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
Secretin synthetic porcine is highly compatible with naturopathic approaches as it works by restoring normal physiological function rather than suppressing symptoms. It can be integrated into comprehensive treatment plans focusing on digestive health optimization. The medication creates a therapeutic window by temporarily normalizing pancreatic function, allowing time for natural healing interventions such as nutritional support, botanical medicines, and lifestyle modifications to take effect. Practitioner education would focus on understanding pancreatic physiology and appropriate diagnostic applications.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
Secretin synthetic porcine is FDA-approved for diagnostic use in pancreatic function testing and gastrinoma evaluation. It is classified as a prescription medication under the category of diagnostic agents. The medication has been approved by various international regulatory agencies including Health Canada and European regulatory bodies for similar diagnostic indications.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other peptide hormones with similar natural derivation profiles that might be found in naturopathic formularies include insulin, growth hormone, and thyroid hormones - all naturally occurring substances used for replacement therapy. The precedent exists for including bioidentical or near-bioidentical hormones that supplement endogenous production and restore normal physiological function.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
DrugBank database provided comprehensive pharmacological information including mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and receptor binding data. PubMed literature review yielded extensive research on secretin physiology, receptor distribution, and clinical applications. FDA prescribing information detailed approved indications, dosing, and safety data. Peer-reviewed physiological literature documented the natural occurrence and function of secretin in digestive regulation.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
Strong evidence supports secretin as a naturally occurring hormone with essential physiological functions. The synthetic porcine version demonstrates nearly identical structure and function to endogenous human secretin. Extensive documentation exists for the natural secretin receptor system and its role in digestive homeostasis. Safety data indicates minimal adverse effects consistent with physiological hormone replacement. Clinical efficacy is well-established for diagnostic applications.<br>
