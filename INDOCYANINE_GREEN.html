# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>INDOCYANINE GREEN</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Indocyanine green (ICG) is a synthetic tricarbocyanine dye that does not occur naturally in plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. There is no documented historical isolation or extraction from natural sources, nor traditional medicine use. The compound is produced through chemical synthesis, not fermentation or biosynthetic methods. ICG was first synthesized in the 1950s at Kodak Research Laboratories as part of near-infrared dye development.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
ICG is a synthetic polymethine cyanine dye with a complex tricarbocyanine structure containing benzindole rings connected by a polymethine chain. While it does not share structural similarity with naturally occurring compounds, it does interact with endogenous proteins, particularly albumin, forming stable non-covalent complexes. The dye's molecular structure allows it to bind reversibly to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, which facilitates its pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
ICG interacts extensively with endogenous systems through high-affinity binding to plasma albumin and hepatic uptake mechanisms. The compound is taken up exclusively by hepatocytes through organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), particularly OATP1B3, which are naturally occurring transporters. ICG is eliminated unchanged through bile without metabolic transformation, utilizing the body's natural hepatobiliary excretion pathways.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
ICG works within evolutionarily conserved hepatobiliary transport systems, utilizing naturally occurring hepatic uptake transporters and biliary excretion mechanisms. It enables assessment of natural physiological processes including hepatic blood flow, cardiac output, and tissue perfusion without disrupting these systems. The compound facilitates diagnostic evaluation that can guide less invasive, natural interventions by providing critical physiological information. ICG imaging enables surgical precision that minimizes tissue damage and supports natural healing processes.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
ICG functions as a diagnostic agent through its unique optical properties and predictable pharmacokinetics. When exposed to near-infrared light (805nm), it fluoresces at 835nm, enabling real-time tissue visualization. The compound's exclusive hepatic uptake and biliary excretion allow assessment of liver function, while its vascular confinement enables cardiac output measurement and tissue perfusion evaluation.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Primary applications include hepatic function assessment, cardiac output measurement, ophthalmic angiography, and intraoperative tissue visualization. ICG is used for sentinel lymph node mapping, assessment of tissue viability, and real-time surgical guidance. The compound has an excellent safety profile with rare adverse reactions, primarily limited to occasional nausea or urticaria. It is used for temporary diagnostic purposes, not long-term treatment.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
ICG is highly compatible with naturopathic approaches as it provides diagnostic information without therapeutic intervention. It enables practitioners to assess physiological function and guide treatment decisions. The compound can create diagnostic windows that inform natural interventions and requires minimal specialized training for interpretation.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
ICG is FDA-approved for cardiac output measurement, hepatic function assessment, and ophthalmic angiography. It is included in hospital formularies worldwide and has been approved for clinical use since 1959. The compound maintains regulatory approval in Europe, Japan, and other international markets.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other diagnostic agents in medical formularies include contrast agents and functional assessment compounds. ICG is unique among diagnostic agents for its exclusive use of natural hepatobiliary pathways and minimal systemic effects.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
Comprehensive review included DrugBank database entries, PubChem compound documentation, FDA prescribing information, peer-reviewed literature on hepatobiliary transport mechanisms, and clinical studies on diagnostic applications.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
Evidence demonstrates ICG's complete integration with natural hepatobiliary transport systems, utilization of endogenous protein binding mechanisms, and facilitation of physiological assessment without system disruption. Safety profile shows minimal adverse effects and no interference with natural processes.<br>

<p>
<strong>Biological Integration:</strong><br>
ICG integrates completely with natural hepatobiliary transport systems, utilizing organic anion transporting polypeptides for hepatic uptake and natural biliary excretion pathways for elimination. The compound works within existing physiological frameworks without disruption.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Natural System Interface:</strong><br>
ICG enables assessment of natural physiological processes including hepatic function, cardiac output, and tissue perfusion. It facilitates diagnostic precision that can guide less invasive interventions and optimize natural healing processes through improved surgical outcomes and reduced tissue trauma.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Safety and Therapeutic Profile:</strong><br>
Excellent safety profile with adverse reactions occurring in <0.05% of patients. Non-toxic, non-metabolized, and rapidly eliminated through natural pathways. Provides diagnostic information without therapeutic intervention or system disruption.<br>
