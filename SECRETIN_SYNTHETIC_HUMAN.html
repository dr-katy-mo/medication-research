# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>SECRETIN SYNTHETIC HUMAN</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Secretin is a naturally occurring hormone originally discovered in 1902 by William Bayliss and Ernest Starling in the duodenal mucosa. The endogenous hormone is produced by S cells in the duodenum and jejunum in response to acidic chyme entering the small intestine from the stomach. The synthetic human secretin is an identical replica of the naturally occurring 27-amino acid peptide hormone found in humans and other mammals. The medication is produced through recombinant DNA technology using controlled fermentation processes with genetically engineered microorganisms, rather than extraction from animal sources.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
Synthetic human secretin is structurally identical to endogenous human secretin, sharing the exact amino acid sequence: His-Ser-Asp-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Glu-Leu-Ser-Arg-Leu-Arg-Asp-Ser-Ala-Arg-Leu-Gln-Arg-Leu-Leu-Gln-Gly-Leu-Val-NH2. It belongs to the secretin-glucagon peptide hormone family and shares structural similarities with other naturally occurring hormones including glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). The molecule contains naturally occurring amino acids in their L-configuration, identical to those found in human physiology.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
Secretin functions through binding to secretin receptors (class B G-protein coupled receptors) naturally present in pancreatic ductal cells, gastric cells, and other tissues. Upon binding, it activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP levels, which triggers the physiological release of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juice and inhibits gastric acid secretion. This mechanism directly supplements the body's natural digestive regulatory system and maintains normal pH balance in the duodenum.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
Secretin synthetic human targets naturally occurring secretin receptors distributed throughout the digestive system, liver, and pancreas. It restores normal physiological function by supplementing deficient endogenous secretin activity, maintaining homeostatic acid-base balance in the digestive tract. The medication enables the body's natural digestive and protective mechanisms by stimulating bicarbonate secretion, which neutralizes gastric acid and creates optimal conditions for pancreatic enzyme function. It works within the evolutionarily conserved enteroendocrine system that regulates digestive processes. By providing temporary hormonal support, it can prevent the need for more invasive interventions while facilitating return to natural physiological digestive function.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
Secretin synthetic human functions by binding to secretin receptors on pancreatic ductal cells, hepatocytes, and gastric parietal cells. This binding activates the cAMP second messenger system, leading to increased bicarbonate and fluid secretion from the pancreas, enhanced bile flow from the liver, and inhibition of gastric acid production. The medication essentially replaces or supplements the natural hormonal signal that coordinates digestive secretions in response to meal ingestion.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Primary therapeutic applications include diagnostic testing of pancreatic function (secretin stimulation test), evaluation of gastrinomas in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and assessment of pancreatic ductal patency. The medication is used as a short-term diagnostic aid with a well-established safety profile. Adverse effects are generally mild and transient, including nausea, flushing, and abdominal discomfort. It is administered as a single intravenous injection for diagnostic purposes, not requiring long-term use.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
Secretin synthetic human is highly compatible with naturopathic approaches as it provides temporary physiological support without disrupting natural processes. It can be integrated into comprehensive digestive health assessments alongside nutritional interventions, herbal therapies, and lifestyle modifications. The medication creates a diagnostic window that can inform targeted natural interventions for pancreatic and digestive support. Practitioner education requirements are minimal due to its specific diagnostic application and established protocols.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
Secretin synthetic human is FDA-approved as a diagnostic agent for pancreatic function testing and gastrinoma evaluation. It received FDA approval in 2002 under the brand name ChiRhoStim. The medication is classified as a diagnostic biological product and is available by prescription for healthcare provider administration.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other peptide hormones and naturally occurring compounds are included in various naturopathic formularies, including insulin, thyroid hormones, and growth factors. The precedent exists for bioidentical hormone replacement and naturally-derived diagnostic agents. Similar gastrointestinal peptides like cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin are recognized in physiological medicine approaches.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
Comprehensive literature review included DrugBank database entries, PubChem compound information, FDA prescribing documentation, peer-reviewed physiological and pharmacological literature, and clinical studies on secretin function and synthetic applications.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
Evidence strongly supports natural derivation through bioidentical structure with endogenous human secretin. Mechanism of action directly targets naturally occurring receptor systems. Clinical evidence demonstrates safety and efficacy for diagnostic applications. Physiological literature confirms integration with natural digestive regulatory pathways.<br>
</p>
