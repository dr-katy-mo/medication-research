# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>PRASTERONE</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
PRASTERONE (dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA) is naturally occurring as an endogenous steroid hormone produced primarily by the adrenal glands, gonads, and brain in humans and other mammals. It is synthesized from cholesterol through the steroidogenic pathway and serves as a precursor to androgens and estrogens. DHEA is also found naturally in wild yam (Dioscorea villosa) and other plant sources, though in different forms that require conversion. Traditional medicine systems have utilized wild yam for hormonal support for centuries. Commercial PRASTERONE is typically produced through semi-synthetic processes starting from plant sterols, particularly diosgenin from wild yam.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
PRASTERONE has the molecular formula C19H28O2 and is structurally identical to endogenous human DHEA. It belongs to the androstane class of steroids and shares core structural features with all human steroid hormones including testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, and progesterone. The compound contains the characteristic steroid backbone with specific hydroxyl and ketone functional groups that define its biological activity. Its structure is evolutionarily conserved across mammalian species.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
PRASTERONE functions through multiple pathways including direct interaction with androgen and estrogen receptors after conversion to active metabolites, modulation of GABA-A receptors as a neurosteroid, and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. It serves as a substrate for 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, integrating into normal steroidogenic pathways. The compound influences immune function, bone metabolism, cardiovascular health, and neurological processes through mechanisms identical to endogenous DHEA.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
PRASTERONE directly targets naturally occurring steroid hormone receptors and enzymatic pathways that have been conserved throughout mammalian evolution. It restores declining DHEA levels that naturally decrease with aging, supporting homeostatic balance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The medication enables endogenous repair mechanisms by providing substrate for local tissue-specific hormone production. It works within the evolutionarily conserved steroidogenic system, supporting natural physiological processes including immune modulation, bone formation, and neuroplasticity. By supplementing declining endogenous levels, it may prevent the need for more invasive hormonal interventions and facilitates return to more youthful physiological states.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
PRASTERONE functions as a prohormone that is converted to active androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues through intracrine mechanisms. It modulates steroid hormone levels in a tissue-specific manner, with conversion rates varying based on local enzyme expression and physiological needs. The compound also acts directly as a neurosteroid, modulating GABA-A and NMDA receptors in the central nervous system. It influences gene expression through steroid hormone receptors and affects multiple signaling pathways including those involved in immune function and metabolism.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
PRASTERONE is FDA-approved for treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause. It is also used off-label for adrenal insufficiency, depression, systemic lupus erythematosus, and age-related decline in DHEA levels. The medication demonstrates good safety and tolerability when used appropriately, with side effects typically related to its androgenic activity. It is generally considered for long-term use in deficiency states, with regular monitoring of hormone levels and clinical parameters.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
PRASTERONE integrates well with naturopathic therapeutic modalities as it supports the body's natural hormone production pathways rather than replacing them entirely. It can be combined with botanical medicines, nutritional interventions, and lifestyle modifications that support adrenal and reproductive health. The medication may create a therapeutic window for other natural interventions to take effect while supporting overall hormonal balance. Practitioners require education in steroid hormone physiology, monitoring parameters, and potential drug interactions.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
PRASTERONE is FDA-approved as a prescription medication (Intrarosa) for specific indications and is also available as a dietary supplement under DSHEA regulations. The European Medicines Agency has approved it for specific medical conditions. It is classified as a controlled substance in some jurisdictions due to its potential use in sports. The compound has been extensively studied and is recognized by major medical organizations for its therapeutic applications.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other bioidentical hormones including testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone are commonly used in naturopathic and integrative medicine practices. DHEA sulfate, the naturally occurring sulfated form, is widely measured clinically. Pregnenolone, another steroid hormone precursor, shares similar properties and applications. These compounds are generally accepted in naturopathic formularies for appropriate indications.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
Comprehensive review of DrugBank, PubChem, PubMed literature, FDA prescribing information, and peer-reviewed publications on steroid hormone physiology and DHEA clinical applications was conducted. Sources included endocrinology textbooks, clinical trial data, and pharmacological reviews of neurosteroid mechanisms.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
Strong evidence supports PRASTERONE as an endogenous compound with well-documented physiological functions. Extensive research demonstrates its role in multiple biological systems and its decline with aging. Clinical studies support its efficacy and safety profile. The compound's integration with natural steroidogenic pathways is well-established in the scientific literature.<br>
