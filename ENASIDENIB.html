# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>ENASIDENIB</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Enasidenib (AG-221) is a synthetic small molecule compound developed through medicinal chemistry approaches. It was not isolated from natural sources nor does it occur naturally in plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. There is no documented traditional medicine use, and it is not produced via fermentation or biosynthetic methods. The compound was specifically designed using structure-based drug design targeting the mutant IDH2 enzyme.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
Enasidenib is a synthetic triazine derivative with the chemical formula C22H24ClFN6O3. While the compound itself does not share structural similarity with naturally occurring compounds, its target enzyme IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2) processes naturally occurring metabolites in the citric acid cycle. The medication does not structurally resemble endogenous human compounds, though its metabolites may interact with natural biochemical pathways.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
Enasidenib specifically inhibits mutant IDH2 enzymes, which are pathologically altered versions of naturally occurring enzymes. The normal IDH2 enzyme is essential for cellular energy metabolism, converting isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. Mutant IDH2 produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which disrupts normal cellular differentiation and epigenetic regulation. By inhibiting this mutant enzyme, enasidenib allows restoration of normal cellular differentiation processes.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
Enasidenib targets a naturally occurring enzyme system (IDH2) that becomes pathologically altered in certain cancers. The medication works by:<br>
</p>
<ul><li>Targeting naturally occurring enzymes (mutant IDH2) to restore normal metabolic function</li>
<li>Enabling restoration of natural cellular differentiation processes that are blocked by oncometabolite accumulation</li>
<li>Working within evolutionarily conserved metabolic pathways (citric acid cycle)</li>
<li>Facilitating return to natural cellular maturation and differentiation</li>
<li>Reducing oncometabolite burden that interferes with normal epigenetic regulation</li>
<li>Potentially preventing need for more intensive chemotherapy interventions</li>
<li>Restoring homeostatic balance in cellular metabolism and differentiation</li></ul>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
Enasidenib is a selective inhibitor of mutant IDH2 enzymes R140Q, R172S, and R172K. These mutations cause the enzyme to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate instead of α-ketoglutarate, leading to impaired cellular differentiation and DNA hypermethylation. By inhibiting the mutant enzyme, enasidenib reduces 2-HG levels, allowing for restoration of normal cellular differentiation and maturation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Enasidenib is FDA-approved for treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with IDH2 mutations. It offers a targeted approach for patients with specific genetic mutations, providing an alternative to intensive chemotherapy regimens. The medication is generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile compared to traditional chemotherapy. It is used for long-term treatment, with patients potentially remaining on therapy for extended periods as long as clinical benefit continues.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
The medication could potentially integrate with supportive naturopathic care focused on immune system support, nutritional optimization, and management of treatment-related side effects. Its mechanism of restoring natural cellular differentiation aligns with naturopathic principles of supporting the body's inherent healing mechanisms. Practitioner education would be required regarding IDH2 mutations, metabolic pathways, and appropriate monitoring.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
Enasidenib received FDA approval in August 2017 under the trade name Idhifa for treating relapsed or refractory AML with IDH2 mutations. It has orphan drug designation and was approved through priority review. The medication is approved by the European Medicines Agency and other international regulatory bodies for similar indications.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) represents a similar class of medications targeting mutant metabolic enzymes. Currently, naturopathic formularies do not typically include targeted cancer therapies, though some include medications that work through restoration of natural processes. The precedent would be novel for targeted oncology medications in naturopathic practice.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
DrugBank database, PubChem compound information, FDA prescribing information, peer-reviewed literature on IDH2 mutations and metabolic pathways, clinical trial data, and biochemical studies on isocitrate dehydrogenase function were reviewed.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
The medication targets a naturally occurring enzyme system that becomes pathologically altered. Strong evidence exists for its mechanism of restoring natural cellular differentiation processes. The safety profile is favorable compared to intensive chemotherapy alternatives. Clinical efficacy is well-documented in IDH2-mutant AML patients.<br>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Natural Derivation Assessment:</strong><br>
Enasidenib is a synthetic compound with no direct natural derivation. However, it demonstrates significant indirect natural connections through its specific targeting of naturally occurring enzyme systems and restoration of natural cellular processes.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Structural/Functional Relationships:</strong><br>
While structurally synthetic, enasidenib targets the naturally occurring IDH2 enzyme system, which is essential for normal cellular metabolism and energy production through the citric acid cycle. The medication's function is specifically designed to restore normal enzymatic activity patterns.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biological Integration:</strong><br>
Enasidenib integrates with natural metabolic pathways by inhibiting pathologically altered IDH2 enzymes, thereby reducing oncometabolite production and allowing restoration of normal cellular differentiation. It works within the evolutionarily conserved citric acid cycle and cellular differentiation mechanisms.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Natural System Interface:</strong><br>
The medication enables restoration of natural cellular maturation processes that are blocked by oncometabolite accumulation. It works by removing the metabolic obstacle (excess 2-hydroxyglutarate) that prevents normal cellular differentiation, allowing natural healing mechanisms to resume function.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Safety and Therapeutic Profile:</strong><br>
Generally well-tolerated with manageable side effects including nausea, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin, and differentiation syndrome. Offers a targeted alternative to intensive chemotherapy with potentially better quality of life outcomes.<br>
