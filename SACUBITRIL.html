# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>SACUBITRIL</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Sacubitril is a synthetic prodrug that does not occur naturally in plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. There is no documented historical isolation or extraction from natural sources, nor traditional medicine use. It is not produced via fermentation or biosynthetic methods from natural organisms. Sacubitril was developed through rational drug design as a synthetic derivative of AHU377.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
Sacubitril shares structural similarity with naturally occurring peptides and amino acid derivatives. It contains an ethyl ester group and a biphenyl structure connected to amino acid-like components. The active metabolite (LBQ657) produced after sacubitril hydrolysis bears structural resemblance to endogenous peptide fragments. The compound's design incorporates naturally occurring amino acid building blocks, particularly related to leucine and phenylalanine derivatives.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
Sacubitril functions by inhibiting neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase), an enzyme that naturally degrades beneficial natriuretic peptides including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). By preventing the breakdown of these endogenous regulatory peptides, sacubitril enhances the body's natural vasodilatory, diuretic, and natriuretic responses. This mechanism works entirely within existing physiological pathways rather than introducing foreign biochemical processes.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
Sacubitril targets neprilysin, a naturally occurring enzyme present throughout human tissues, particularly in the kidneys, lungs, and vascular endothelium. The medication restores homeostatic balance by preserving naturally produced cardioprotective peptides that are typically degraded too rapidly in heart failure states. It enables endogenous repair mechanisms by allowing the body's own natriuretic peptide system to function more effectively. The intervention removes obstacles to natural healing by preventing the enzymatic breakdown of beneficial endogenous compounds. The neprilysin enzyme system is evolutionarily conserved across species, indicating fundamental biological importance. Sacubitril can prevent the need for more invasive interventions like mechanical circulatory support or transplantation by optimizing natural cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
Sacubitril is administered as a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active metabolite LBQ657, which selectively inhibits neprilysin. This inhibition prevents the degradation of natriuretic peptides, leading to increased levels of ANP, BNP, and CNP. These endogenous peptides promote vasodilation, increase sodium excretion, reduce fluid retention, and provide cardioprotective effects. The mechanism works by enhancing existing physiological processes rather than introducing artificial pathways.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Primary therapeutic application is in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where it is used in combination with valsartan (as sacubitril/valsartan). The medication has demonstrated superior outcomes compared to ACE inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations. It is generally well-tolerated with a safety profile comparable to standard heart failure medications. The treatment is typically considered for long-term use as part of guideline-directed medical therapy for chronic heart failure management.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
Sacubitril is highly compatible with naturopathic therapeutic modalities as it works by optimizing the body's own regulatory systems. It can be integrated into comprehensive treatment plans alongside dietary modifications, exercise programs, and stress management techniques. The medication creates a therapeutic window that allows natural interventions to be more effective by improving overall cardiovascular function and reducing symptoms that might limit patient participation in lifestyle modifications.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
Sacubitril is FDA-approved as part of the combination product sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto) for heart failure treatment. It has received approval from multiple international regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The combination is included in major clinical guidelines including those from the American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, and American College of Cardiology as a Class I recommendation for HFrEF.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other medications that work by modulating endogenous enzyme systems are present in various formularies, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs which affect the renin-angiotensin system. The concept of inhibiting enzymes that break down beneficial endogenous compounds is well-established in cardiovascular medicine. Sacubitril represents a similar approach but targets a different enzymatic pathway (neprilysin rather than ACE).<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
Evidence was gathered from DrugBank database for comprehensive drug information, PubChem for chemical structure and properties, FDA prescribing information for regulatory details, and peer-reviewed cardiovascular literature for mechanism and clinical data. Physiological literature on the natriuretic peptide system and neprilysin function was reviewed to understand the natural systems involved.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
While sacubitril is synthetic in origin, it demonstrates strong integration with natural physiological systems by targeting an endogenous enzyme and preserving naturally occurring cardioprotective peptides. The mechanism of action works entirely within evolved cardiovascular regulatory pathways. Clinical evidence supports significant therapeutic benefit with acceptable safety profile. The approach of preserving beneficial endogenous compounds aligns with naturopathic principles of supporting natural healing mechanisms.<br>
