            <p>Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol</p>

<p># Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment For <strong>PATISIRAN</strong>: ## <h2>1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT</h2></p>

<p>### <h3>Source Investigation</h3> Patisiran functions through the evolutionarily conserved RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) pathway. Patisiran functions as a double-stranded siRNA that specifically targets TTR mRNA through complementary base pairing. While developed through modern medicinal chemistry, the medication was intentionally crafted to engage these conserved pathways so clinicians can modulate them in a targeted way. PATISIRAN works through established physiological pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. PATISIRAN is structurally related to naturally occurring compounds, sharing key molecular features that enable its therapeutic action. Patisiran is a synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) consisting of 21 nucleotides. While the compound itself is synthetically manufactured, it is composed entirely of ribonucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil) which are naturally occurring building blocks of RNA found in all living organisms. The siRNA utilizes the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a naturally conserved gene regulation mechanism present across species from plants to mammals. No direct natural occurrence of this specific siRNA sequence has been documented, nor is there traditional medicine use for this particular compound.</p>

<h3>Structural Analysis</h3> Patisiran&#x27;s structure consists of a double-stranded RNA duplex with naturally occurring nucleotides arranged in a specific sequence. Each nucleotide contains ribose sugar, phosphate groups, and purine/pyrimidine bases that are identical to those found in endogenous human RNA. The compound includes chemical modifications (2&#x27;-O-methyl groups and phosphorothioate linkages) to enhance stability, and the core structure remains fundamentally similar to naturally occurring siRNA molecules produced by human cells through the Dicer enzyme system.

<h3>Biological Mechanism Evaluation</h3> Patisiran functions through the evolutionarily conserved RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) pathway. After cellular uptake, it integrates with endogenous Argonaute proteins and utilizes the natural mRNA cleavage machinery to reduce transthyretin (TTR) protein production. This mechanism leverages the same cellular processes used for endogenous microRNA regulation, working entirely within naturally occurring gene expression control systems present in human hepatocytes.

<h3>Natural System Integration</h3> (Expanded Assessment) Patisiran targets the naturally occurring TTR gene and utilizes endogenous RNA processing machinery including RISC complexes and Argonaute proteins. It restores homeostatic balance by reducing pathological protein accumulation in hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR). The medication enables natural cellular clearance mechanisms to function more effectively by reducing the burden of misfolded protein deposits. It works within the evolutionarily conserved gene silencing system present in all mammalian cells. By reducing toxic protein accumulation, it prevents progressive organ damage and facilitates restoration of normal tissue function, particularly in cardiac and neurological systems.

<h2>2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Mechanism of Action Patisiran functions as a double-stranded siRNA that specifically targets TTR mRNA through complementary base pairing. Upon hepatocyte uptake via lipid nanoparticle delivery, it associates with the RISC complex and guides sequence-specific cleavage of TTR mRNA, resulting in reduced synthesis of both wild-type and variant TTR proteins. This reduces circulating TTR levels by approximately 80% and decreases amyloid fibril formation and deposition in affected tissues.</p>

<h3>Clinical Utility</h3> Primary indication is hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) in adults with polyneuropathy. Clinical trials demonstrate significant improvement in neuropathy progression, quality of life measures, and nutritional status. The medication is administered intravenously every 3 weeks under medical supervision. Safety profile shows generally well-tolerated treatment with infusion-related reactions being the most common adverse events. Long-term use is typically required given the progressive nature of the underlying condition.

<h3>Integration Potential</h3> Compatible with supportive naturopathic interventions including nutritional support, hepatic support protocols, and cardiovascular health measures. The medication creates a therapeutic window by slowing disease progression, allowing time for implementation of comprehensive natural support strategies. Requires specialized practitioner training for administration and monitoring protocols, particularly regarding infusion procedures and patient selection criteria.

<h2>3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Current Status FDA approved in August 2018 for the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. Approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018. Designated as an orphan drug for rare disease treatment. Not currently included in WHO Essential Medicines List due to its specialized indication and high cost considerations.</p>

<h3>Comparable Medications</h3> First siRNA therapeutic approved for systemic use, representing a novel class in clinical medicine. While no structurally identical medications exist in current naturopathic formularies, the mechanism of working through endogenous cellular machinery parallels other formulary inclusions that utilize natural physiological processes. The precedent for nucleotide-based therapeutics exists with various B-vitamin coenzymes and nucleotide supplements already accepted in naturopathic practice.

<h3>Formulary Precedent Analysis</h3>

<p>This medication aligns with established formulary principles that recognize both naturally-derived and laboratory-produced compounds when they demonstrate therapeutic value and integration with physiological systems. Similar to synthetic hormones already included in the formulary (ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine), this medication demonstrates that production method works to preclude formulary inclusion when the therapeutic mechanism aligns with natural physiological processes. The precedent established by medications like tretinoin, sucralfate, and cholestyramine supports inclusion of compounds that work through natural pathways regardless of their origin.</p>
