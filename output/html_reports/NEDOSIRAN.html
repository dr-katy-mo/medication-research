            <p>Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol</p>

<p># Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment For <strong>NEDOSIRAN</strong>: ## <h2>1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT</h2></p>

<p>### <h3>Source Investigation</h3> Nedosiran operates through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, an evolutionarily conserved cellular mechanism present across species from plants to mammals. Nedosiran functions as a substrate-specific inhibitor targeting hepatic LDHA mRNA through RNA interference. While developed through modern medicinal chemistry, the medication was intentionally crafted to engage these conserved pathways so clinicians can modulate them in a targeted way. NEDOSIRAN works through established physiological pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. NEDOSIRAN is structurally related to naturally occurring compounds, sharing key molecular features that enable its therapeutic action. Nedosiran is a synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule designed using artificial nucleotide chemistry. It is not directly isolated from natural sources such as plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. There is no documented traditional medicine use of this specific compound. Production occurs through synthetic chemical manufacturing processes rather than fermentation or biosynthetic methods using living organisms.</p>

<h3>Structural Analysis</h3> Nedosiran is structurally based on naturally occurring RNA molecules found in all living cells. The compound consists of modified ribonucleotides that share the fundamental sugar-phosphate backbone structure with endogenous RNA. Key structural features include ribose sugars, phosphate linkages, and purine/pyrimidine bases that are identical to those found in natural RNA. The modifications include chemical alterations to enhance stability and cellular uptake while maintaining the native Watson-Crick base-pairing capability essential for RNA interference mechanisms.

<h3>Biological Mechanism Evaluation</h3> Nedosiran operates through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, an evolutionarily conserved cellular mechanism present across species from plants to mammals. The medication targets the endogenous RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), utilizing the cell&#x27;s natural machinery for gene regulation. It specifically regulates hepatic lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) mRNA, reducing oxalate production by decreasing conversion of glyoxylate to oxalate. This mechanism works entirely within existing cellular regulatory systems without introducing foreign biochemical pathways.

<h3>Natural System Integration</h3> (Expanded Assessment) Nedosiran targets naturally occurring enzymes (LDHA) and utilizes evolutionarily conserved RNA interference machinery present in human cells. The medication restores metabolic balance by reducing pathological oxalate overproduction, addressing the underlying biochemical dysfunction in primary hyperoxaluria. It enables the body&#x27;s natural ability to maintain appropriate oxalate levels by removing the obstacle of excessive LDHA-mediated oxalate synthesis. The intervention works within established cellular regulatory mechanisms and prevents the need for more invasive treatments such as organ transplantation. By normalizing oxalate metabolism, it facilitates return to physiological homeostasis.

<h2>2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Mechanism of Action Nedosiran functions as a substrate-specific inhibitor targeting hepatic LDHA mRNA through RNA interference. Upon cellular uptake, it associates with the RISC complex, leading to sequence-specific cleavage and degradation of LDHA mRNA. This reduces LDHA enzyme levels, decreasing the conversion of glyoxylate to oxalate in hepatocytes. The reduction in oxalate synthesis addresses the primary metabolic dysfunction in hyperoxaluria conditions, working through the cell&#x27;s endogenous gene regulation machinery.</p>

<h3>Clinical Utility</h3> Nedosiran is indicated for primary hyperoxaluria, a rare genetic disorder causing excessive oxalate production leading to kidney stones and progressive kidney damage. The medication provides targeted reduction of urinary oxalate excretion, potentially preventing kidney stone formation and preserving renal function. Safety data indicates generally good tolerability with primarily injection site reactions. The medication is intended for long-term use given the chronic nature of the underlying genetic condition, though it addresses root metabolic dysfunction rather than merely managing symptoms.

<h3>Integration Potential</h3> The medication&#x27;s mechanism aligns with naturopathic principles by addressing underlying metabolic dysfunction rather than suppressing symptoms. It could integrate into comprehensive treatment protocols alongside nutritional modifications and hydration therapy. The medication may create therapeutic windows allowing for dietary interventions and lifestyle modifications to be more effective. Practitioner education would focus on understanding RNA interference mechanisms and monitoring oxalate metabolism parameters.

<h2>3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Current Status Nedosiran has received FDA approval for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 in patients with advanced kidney disease. The European Medicines Agency has also granted marketing authorization. It is classified as an orphan drug due to the rarity of the target condition. The medication is not currently listed on the WHO Essential Medicines List, likely due to its recent approval and specialized indication.</p>

<h3>Comparable Medications</h3> Other RNA-based therapeutics have been approved for various conditions, establishing regulatory precedent for this class of molecules. The naturopathic formulary includes other medications that work through endogenous regulatory mechanisms, though nedosiran represents a novel approach using synthetic RNA molecules. Similar to other formulary medications, it targets natural enzymatic pathways to restore physiological balance.

<h3>Formulary Precedent Analysis</h3>

<p>This medication aligns with established formulary principles that recognize both naturally-derived and laboratory-produced compounds when they demonstrate therapeutic value and integration with physiological systems. Similar to synthetic hormones already included in the formulary (ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine), this medication demonstrates that production method works to preclude formulary inclusion when the therapeutic mechanism aligns with natural physiological processes. The precedent established by medications like tretinoin, sucralfate, and cholestyramine supports inclusion of compounds that work through natural pathways regardless of their origin.</p>
