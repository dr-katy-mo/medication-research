            <p>Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol</p>

<p># Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment For <strong>TEPOTINIB</strong>: ## <h2>1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT</h2></p>

<p>### <h3>Source Investigation</h3> Tepotinib functions as a highly selective inhibitor of the MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) receptor tyrosine kinase. Tepotinib selectively regulates the MET receptor tyrosine kinase by competing with ATP for binding to the kinase domain. While developed through modern medicinal chemistry, the medication was intentionally crafted to engage these conserved pathways so clinicians can modulate them in a targeted way. Tepotinib (trade name Tepmetko) is a synthetic small molecule kinase inhibitor with synthesized through pharmaceutical processes rather than extracted from natural sources. There is no documented historical isolation from natural sources or traditional medicine use. The compound is not produced via fermentation or biosynthetic methods, and rather through synthetic organic chemistry processes involving multi-step synthesis of a pyrimidine-based scaffold.</p>

<h3>Structural Analysis</h3> Tepotinib is a synthetic molecule with the chemical formula C23H24N6O2 and contains a pyrimidine core structure linked to an indazole moiety. While pyrimidine rings occur naturally in nucleotides (cytosine, thymine, uracil), tepotinib&#x27;s specific structure and substitution pattern do not occur naturally. The compound works to share significant structural similarity with endogenous human compounds or known natural products. Its metabolic products include demethylated and hydroxylated derivatives that also lack natural analogs.

<h3>Biological Mechanism Evaluation</h3> Tepotinib functions as a highly selective inhibitor of the MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) receptor tyrosine kinase. The MET receptor is an endogenous human protein that plays crucial roles in normal physiological processes including embryonic development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. The MET signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and regulates cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival. In cancer, MET signaling becomes dysregulated, and tepotinib works to restore normal signaling balance by selectively inhibiting aberrant MET activation.

<h3>Natural System Integration</h3> (Expanded Assessment) Tepotinib targets the naturally occurring MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which is part of evolutionarily conserved cellular signaling systems. The medication works to restore homeostatic balance by correcting aberrant MET signaling that occurs in MET exon 14 skipping mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. By selectively inhibiting dysregulated MET activity while preserving normal physiological MET function at therapeutic doses, tepotinib enables endogenous cellular repair mechanisms to function properly. The targeted approach removes obstacles to natural healing processes by addressing the specific molecular aberration driving cancer progression, potentially preventing the need for more invasive interventions such as extensive surgical resection or combination chemotherapy regimens.

<h2>2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Mechanism of Action Tepotinib selectively regulates the MET receptor tyrosine kinase by competing with ATP for binding to the kinase domain. This inhibition blocks downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways that are dysregulated in tumors with MET alterations. The medication has particular selectivity for MET compared to other kinases, with IC50 values demonstrating &gt;100-fold selectivity over most other kinases tested. The targeted inhibition works within the natural cellular signaling framework to restore normal growth control mechanisms.</p>

<h3>Clinical Utility</h3> Tepotinib is FDA-approved specifically for adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations. Clinical trials demonstrated objective response rates of approximately 46% with median duration of response exceeding 11 months. The medication offers targeted therapy for patients who previously had limited treatment options for this specific genetic alteration. Safety profile shows manageable adverse effects primarily including peripheral edema, nausea, and fatigue, with most events being grade 1-2 severity.

<h3>Integration Potential</h3> As a targeted therapy addressing a specific molecular aberration, tepotinib could potentially be integrated into comprehensive oncological care plans alongside supportive naturopathic modalities focused on optimizing overall health, immune function, and quality of life. The medication&#x27;s targeted mechanism may create therapeutic windows where natural interventions supporting general wellness could be implemented. Practitioner education would require understanding of MET biology, molecular testing requirements, and coordination with oncological care teams.

<h2>3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Current Status Tepotinib received FDA approval in February 2021 under accelerated approval pathway for metastatic NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping alterations. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted conditional marketing authorization in February 2021. The medication is classified as a prescription-only medicine and requires companion diagnostic testing to identify appropriate patients. It is not currently listed on the WHO Essential Medicines List.</p>

<h3>Comparable Medications</h3> Other targeted kinase inhibitors such as imatinib (targeting BCR-ABL) and erlotinib (targeting EGFR) represent precedents for synthetic molecules that work through selective inhibition of dysregulated endogenous protein kinases. These medications share the therapeutic approach of correcting specific molecular abnormalities in cancer cells while working within natural cellular signaling frameworks.

<h3>Formulary Precedent Analysis</h3>

<p>This medication aligns with established formulary principles that recognize both naturally-derived and laboratory-produced compounds when they demonstrate therapeutic value and integration with physiological systems. Similar to synthetic hormones already included in the formulary (ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine), this medication demonstrates that production method works to preclude formulary inclusion when the therapeutic mechanism aligns with natural physiological processes. The precedent established by medications like tretinoin, sucralfate, and cholestyramine supports inclusion of compounds that work through natural pathways regardless of their origin.</p>

The medication works within evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways including PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK cascades that regulate fundamental cellular processes.</p><p><strong>Natural System Interface:</strong></p>

<p>This synthetic medication operates by correcting specific molecular abnormalities in the naturally occurring MET signaling system. By selectively targeting dysregulated MET activity in cancer cells, tepotinib enables natural cellular growth control mechanisms to function properly, potentially restoring physiological balance and supporting endogenous repair processes.</p><p><strong>Safety and Therapeutic Profile:</strong></p>

<p>Clinical trials demonstrate manageable adverse effects primarily consisting of peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea, with most events being grade 1-2. The targeted approach offers a less invasive alternative to broad-spectrum chemotherapy for patients with MET-driven lung cancer, with objective response rates of approximately 46%.</p><p><strong>Summary of Findings:</strong></p>
