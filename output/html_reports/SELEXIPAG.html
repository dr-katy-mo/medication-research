            <p>Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol</p>

<p># Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment For <strong>SELEXIPAG</strong>: ## <h2>1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT</h2></p>

<p>### <h3>Source Investigation</h3> Selexipag functions as a selective agonist of the prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor), which is the same receptor targeted by endogenous prostacyclin. Selexipag acts as a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist, binding to IP receptors on pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets. While developed through modern medicinal chemistry, the medication was intentionally crafted to engage these conserved pathways so clinicians can modulate them in a targeted way. SELEXIPAG works through established physiological pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. SELEXIPAG is identical to compounds naturally produced in the human body. Selexipag is a synthetic small molecule that was developed through pharmaceutical research and is not found naturally occurring in plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. There is no documented historical isolation or extraction from natural sources, nor traditional medicine use. The compound is not produced via fermentation or biosynthetic methods and rather through synthetic organic chemistry processes.</p>

<h3>Structural Analysis</h3> Selexipag is structurally designed as a selective prostacyclin (IP) receptor agonist. While designed for therapeutic purposes itself, it demonstrates structural similarity to prostacyclin (PGI2), an endogenous compound derived from arachidonic acid. Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring prostaglandin that plays crucial roles in vascular homeostasis, platelet aggregation inhibition, and vasodilation. Selexipag shares functional groups that enable interaction with the same prostacyclin receptors as the endogenous compound. The medication&#x27;s active metabolite (ACT-333679) has enhanced selectivity and stability compared to natural prostacyclin.

<h3>Biological Mechanism Evaluation</h3> Selexipag functions as a selective agonist of the prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor), which is the same receptor targeted by endogenous prostacyclin. This represents direct interaction with naturally occurring receptor systems that are integral to cardiovascular homeostasis. The medication works within the prostacyclin-cAMP signaling pathway, which is a fundamental physiological process involved in vascular smooth muscle relaxation, platelet function regulation, and endothelial protection. By activating these endogenous pathways, selexipag supplements deficient prostacyclin signaling in pulmonary arterial hypertension.

<h3>Natural System Integration</h3> (Expanded Assessment) Selexipag targets the naturally occurring prostacyclin receptor system, which is evolutionarily conserved and essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. The medication works to restore balance in the prostacyclin pathway, which becomes dysregulated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). By enhancing prostacyclin signaling, it enables endogenous vasodilatory and anti-proliferative mechanisms in pulmonary vasculature. The drug facilitates return to more normal physiological function in pulmonary circulation and may prevent progression requiring more invasive interventions such as lung transplantation. It works within evolutionarily conserved G-protein coupled receptor systems and cAMP signaling cascades.

<h2>2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Mechanism of Action Selexipag acts as a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist, binding to IP receptors on pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets. Upon receptor activation, it increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, leading to vasodilation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, and reduced platelet aggregation. This mechanism directly parallels the action of endogenous prostacyclin, working within natural physiological pathways to restore vascular homeostasis in the pulmonary circulation.</p>

<h3>Clinical Utility</h3> Selexipag is primarily indicated for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to delay disease progression and reduce risk of PAH-related hospitalization. It serves as an oral alternative to prostacyclin analogs that require continuous infusion. The medication demonstrates good tolerability with a safety profile consistent with prostacyclin pathway activation. It is typically used as long-term therapy and may create therapeutic windows that allow for implementation of other interventions. Clinical trials have shown significant reduction in PAH progression and improvement in exercise capacity.

<h3>Integration Potential</h3> Selexipag has good compatibility with naturopathic therapeutic modalities as it works through enhancement of natural physiological pathways rather than blocking them. It can be integrated into comprehensive treatment plans that include nutritional support, exercise therapy, and other interventions targeting endothelial function. The medication may create therapeutic stability that allows patients to engage more effectively with lifestyle and natural interventions. Practitioners require understanding of prostacyclin physiology and PAH pathophysiology for optimal integration.

<h2>3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Current Status Selexipag is FDA-approved for treatment of PAH and is classified as a prescription medication. It received FDA approval in 2015 based on the GRIPHON trial results. The medication is approved in multiple international jurisdictions including the European Union, Canada, and Japan. It is not currently listed on the WHO Essential Medicines List, reflecting its specialized indication and newer approval status.</p>

<h3>Comparable Medications</h3> Other prostacyclin pathway modulators like epoprostenol and treprostinil are used in conventional PAH treatment and require complex delivery systems. Selexipag represents the first oral prostacyclin receptor agonist, offering advantages in administration while maintaining the same fundamental mechanism. The prostacyclin class has established precedent for targeting natural receptor systems in cardiovascular disease management.

<h3>Formulary Precedent Analysis</h3>

<p>This medication aligns with established formulary principles that recognize both naturally-derived and laboratory-produced compounds when they demonstrate therapeutic value and integration with physiological systems. Similar to synthetic hormones already included in the formulary (ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine), this medication demonstrates that production method works to preclude formulary inclusion when the therapeutic mechanism aligns with natural physiological processes. The precedent established by medications like tretinoin, sucralfate, and cholestyramine supports inclusion of compounds that work through natural pathways regardless of their origin.</p>
