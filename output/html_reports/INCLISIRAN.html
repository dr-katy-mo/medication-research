            <p>Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol</p>

<p># Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment For <strong>INCLISIRAN</strong>: ## <h2>1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT</h2></p>

<p>### <h3>Source Investigation</h3> Inclisiran functions through the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a naturally conserved cellular mechanism for gene regulation. Inclisiran functions as a small interfering RNA that targets hepatic PCSK9 mRNA for degradation through the natural RNAi pathway. While developed through modern medicinal chemistry, the medication was intentionally crafted to engage these conserved pathways so clinicians can modulate them in a targeted way. INCLISIRAN works through established physiological pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. INCLISIRAN belongs to the statin class of medications, which originated from natural fungal metabolites. Inclisiran is a synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule designed to target PCSK9 mRNA. It is not directly derived from natural sources through extraction or isolation from plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. The compound is manufactured through synthetic oligonucleotide chemistry rather than fermentation or biosynthetic methods. There is no documentation of traditional medicine use, as this is a novel pharmaceutical developed through modern molecular biology techniques.</p>

<h3>Structural Analysis</h3> Inclisiran is a double-stranded siRNA consisting of 21 nucleotides per strand with specific chemical modifications including 2&#x27;-O-methyl and 2&#x27;-fluoro modifications for stability. While the basic RNA structure utilizes naturally occurring nucleotide building blocks (adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil), the specific sequence is artificially designed, and the chemical modifications are synthetic. The molecule does share fundamental structural components with endogenous human RNA molecules, particularly in its phosphodiester backbone and ribose sugar components.

<h3>Biological Mechanism Evaluation</h3> Inclisiran functions through the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a naturally conserved cellular mechanism for gene regulation. The siRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is an evolutionarily ancient system present across species. This mechanism targets PCSK9 mRNA for degradation, reducing PCSK9 protein production and subsequently increasing LDL receptor recycling - processes that work entirely within natural cellular regulatory systems.

<h3>Natural System Integration</h3> (Expanded Assessment) Inclisiran targets the naturally occurring PCSK9 enzyme, which is part of the endogenous cholesterol homeostasis system. By reducing PCSK9 levels, it removes an obstacle to natural LDL receptor function, allowing the body&#x27;s inherent cholesterol regulation mechanisms to operate more effectively. The medication works through evolutionarily conserved RNA interference pathways and enables the restoration of natural LDL receptor recycling processes. It facilitates a return to more physiologically normal cholesterol metabolism by removing PCSK9-mediated inhibition of the body&#x27;s natural cholesterol clearance mechanisms.

<h2>2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Mechanism of Action Inclisiran functions as a small interfering RNA that targets hepatic PCSK9 mRNA for degradation through the natural RNAi pathway. Once administered subcutaneously, it is taken up by hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor through its triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugate. The siRNA is incorporated into RISC, which cleaves complementary PCSK9 mRNA, reducing PCSK9 protein synthesis. This leads to increased LDL receptor availability on hepatocyte surfaces, enhancing LDL cholesterol clearance from circulation.</p>

<h3>Clinical Utility</h3> Inclisiran is indicated as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional LDL-C reduction. It provides sustained LDL cholesterol reduction with twice-yearly dosing, offering an alternative for patients who serves to tolerate daily medications or require additional cholesterol lowering beyond statins. Clinical trials demonstrate 50-52% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with a generally favorable safety profile.

<h3>Integration Potential</h3> The medication&#x27;s infrequent dosing schedule (twice yearly after initial and 3-month doses) makes it compatible with comprehensive naturopathic treatment plans. It can create a therapeutic window for implementing lifestyle interventions, dietary modifications, and other naturopathic modalities while providing sustained cholesterol management. The non-systemic nature of its action (primarily hepatic) may complement rather than interfere with other therapeutic approaches.

<h2>3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Current Status Inclisiran received FDA approval in December 2021 under the brand name Leqvio for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has also received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Health Canada. The medication is classified as a prescription-only medicine and requires subcutaneous administration by healthcare professionals.</p>

<h3>Comparable Medications</h3> While no other siRNA medications are currently in naturopathic formularies, there are precedents for including synthetic medications that work through natural pathways. The unique mechanism of using endogenous RNAi machinery represents a novel therapeutic class. Other cholesterol-lowering medications in various formularies work through different mechanisms, making direct comparisons limited.

<h3>Formulary Precedent Analysis</h3>

<p>This medication aligns with established formulary principles that recognize both naturally-derived and laboratory-produced compounds when they demonstrate therapeutic value and integration with physiological systems. Similar to synthetic hormones already included in the formulary (ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine), this medication demonstrates that production method works to preclude formulary inclusion when the therapeutic mechanism aligns with natural physiological processes. The precedent established by medications like tretinoin, sucralfate, and cholestyramine supports inclusion of compounds that work through natural pathways regardless of their origin.</p>
