            <p>Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol</p>

<p># Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment For <strong>OMAVELOXOLONE</strong>: ## <h2>1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT</h2></p>

<p>### <h3>Source Investigation</h3> The compound functions as a potent activator of the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, a highly conserved cellular defense mechanism present across species. Omaveloxolone functions as a reversible covalent modifier of Keap1, the cytoplasmic repressor of Nrf2. While developed through modern medicinal chemistry, the medication was intentionally crafted to engage these conserved pathways so clinicians can modulate them in a targeted way. OMAVELOXOLONE works through established physiological pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. OMAVELOXOLONE is produced through modification of natural compounds, preserving the essential natural framework while enhancing therapeutic properties. Omaveloxolone is a synthetic triterpenoid derivative based on oleanolic acid, a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid found extensively in plants. Oleanolic acid is present in olive leaves, grape skins, rosemary, and numerous other botanical sources. The compound represents a semi-synthetic modification of this natural scaffold, specifically designed as an Nrf2 activator.</p>

<h3>Structural Analysis</h3> Omaveloxolone maintains the fundamental pentacyclic triterpenoid backbone of oleanolic acid with strategic modifications including a cyanoenone group that enhances its electrophilic properties. This structural relationship to naturally occurring triterpenoids is significant, as these compounds represent one of the largest classes of plant secondary metabolites. The modifications preserve the core scaffold that has evolved in plants as protective compounds, while optimizing the molecule&#x27;s ability to interact with cellular defense pathways.

<h3>Biological Mechanism Evaluation</h3> The compound functions as a potent activator of the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, a highly conserved cellular defense mechanism present across species. Nrf2 is an endogenous transcription factor that regulates antioxidant response elements and cytoprotective genes. This pathway represents a fundamental cellular defense system that has evolved to protect against oxidative stress and environmental toxins. Omaveloxolone&#x27;s mechanism directly engages this evolutionarily conserved protective system.

<h3>Natural System Integration</h3> (Expanded Assessment) Omaveloxolone targets the naturally occurring Keap1-Nrf2 system, which serves as the master regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses. By binding to cysteine residues on Keap1, it liberates Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus and activate protective gene expression. This mechanism restores homeostatic balance in conditions where endogenous antioxidant systems are overwhelmed. The compound enables endogenous repair mechanisms by upregulating phase II detoxification enzymes, antioxidant proteins, and anti-inflammatory pathways. It works within an evolutionarily conserved system present from primitive organisms to humans, facilitating the return to natural physiological redox balance without disrupting normal cellular function.

<h2>2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Mechanism of Action Omaveloxolone functions as a reversible covalent modifier of Keap1, the cytoplasmic repressor of Nrf2. Under normal conditions, Keap1 sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and targets it for degradation. Omaveloxolone forms reversible covalent bonds with specific cysteine residues on Keap1, disrupting this interaction and allowing Nrf2 to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus. Once nuclear, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements and activates transcription of cytoprotective genes including glutathione synthesis enzymes, antioxidant proteins, and detoxification enzymes.</p>

<h3>Clinical Utility</h3> Omaveloxolone is FDA-approved for the treatment of Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The medication addresses the underlying pathophysiology by enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity and improving mitochondrial function. Clinical trials demonstrated improvements in neurological function scores and reduction in disease progression markers. The compound offers a targeted approach to addressing oxidative stress-mediated pathology in conditions where conventional antioxidant supplementation has proven insufficient.

<h3>Integration Potential</h3> The medication shows strong compatibility with naturopathic therapeutic modalities focused on supporting endogenous detoxification and antioxidant systems. It could complement nutritional interventions aimed at supporting glutathione synthesis, mitochondrial function, and cellular repair mechanisms. The compound creates a therapeutic window by enhancing cellular defense capacity, potentially allowing natural interventions to be more effective in conditions of severe oxidative stress.

<h2>3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT</h2>

<p>### Current Status Omaveloxolone received FDA approval in February 2023 under the brand name Skyclarys for the treatment of Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. It was granted orphan drug designation due to the rarity of the condition. The European Medicines Agency has also granted orphan designation for the same indication.</p>

<h3>Comparable Medications</h3> The current naturopathic formulary includes various compounds that work through similar pathways, including sulforaphane (an Nrf2 activator derived from cruciferous vegetables) and other plant-derived compounds that modulate antioxidant response elements. The acceptance of these naturally-derived Nrf2 modulators establishes precedent for compounds targeting this pathway, with omaveloxolone representing a more potent synthetic analog of naturally occurring triterpenoid Nrf2 activators.

<h3>Formulary Precedent Analysis</h3>

<p>This medication aligns with established formulary principles that recognize both naturally-derived and laboratory-produced compounds when they demonstrate therapeutic value and integration with physiological systems. Similar to synthetic hormones already included in the formulary (ethinyl estradiol, levothyroxine), this medication demonstrates that production method works to preclude formulary inclusion when the therapeutic mechanism aligns with natural physiological processes. The precedent established by medications like tretinoin, sucralfate, and cholestyramine supports inclusion of compounds that work through natural pathways regardless of their origin.</p>
