# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>SOLRIAMFETOL</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Solriamfetol (R-2-amino-3-phenylpropyl carbamate) is a synthetic compound not found in nature. No documentation exists of its natural occurrence in plants, animals, fungi, minerals, or marine organisms. It is not derived from fermentation processes or biosynthetic methods using natural organisms. There is no historical use in traditional medicine systems, as it is a recently developed pharmaceutical compound first synthesized in the early 2000s for pharmaceutical applications.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
Solriamfetol is structurally related to phenylalanine, an essential amino acid naturally present in proteins and the human body. The molecule contains a phenylpropylamine backbone similar to naturally occurring catecholamines and amino acids. It shares structural features with dopamine and norepinephrine, including the phenyl ring and amino group positioning. The carbamate functional group, while synthetic, creates a prodrug mechanism that allows controlled release of the active moiety. The compound's R-enantiomer configuration mimics the stereochemistry found in naturally occurring amino acids.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
Solriamfetol primarily functions as a dual dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI), working with endogenous neurotransmitter systems. It blocks dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), increasing synaptic concentrations of these naturally occurring neurotransmitters. The mechanism supports normal physiological arousal and alertness pathways without directly stimulating neurotransmitter release, instead optimizing the utilization of endogenously produced dopamine and norepinephrine.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
Solriamfetol targets evolutionarily conserved monoamine transporter systems present across vertebrate species. It works within the natural dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways that regulate arousal, attention, and wakefulness. The medication helps restore normal sleep-wake homeostasis in patients with narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea by enhancing the efficiency of endogenous neurotransmitter systems. It enables the body's natural arousal mechanisms to function more effectively rather than artificially stimulating them. The compound may prevent the need for more aggressive stimulant medications with higher abuse potential.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
Solriamfetol inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters with IC50 values of 4.9 μM and 9.9 μM respectively. Unlike traditional stimulants, it does not promote neurotransmitter release or interfere with vesicular storage. The compound undergoes minimal metabolism, with approximately 95% excreted unchanged, reducing metabolic burden. It has low affinity for other neurotransmitter systems, providing selective action on monoamine reuptake without significant off-target effects.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Solriamfetol is FDA-approved for treating excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. It provides sustained wakefulness promotion with once-daily dosing. The medication has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials with lower abuse potential compared to traditional stimulants (Schedule IV vs Schedule II). Common side effects include headache, nausea, decreased appetite, and anxiety. It offers an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond adequately to modafinil or traditional stimulants.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
Solriamfetol can complement comprehensive sleep disorder management that includes sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm optimization, and addressing underlying causes of sleep disruption. It may create a therapeutic window allowing patients to engage more effectively in lifestyle modifications and other naturopathic interventions. The medication's mechanism of enhancing endogenous neurotransmitter function aligns with approaches that support natural physiological processes rather than overriding them.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
Solriamfetol (Sunosi) received FDA approval in March 2019 as a Schedule IV controlled substance. It is approved by Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency for similar indications. The medication is not currently listed on the WHO Essential Medicines List, likely due to its recent introduction and specialized indication.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other wake-promoting agents like modafinil and armodafinil work through different mechanisms but target similar clinical conditions. Traditional stimulants (amphetamines, methylphenidate) are more heavily controlled substances (Schedule II) with higher abuse potential. Solriamfetol's unique DNRI mechanism and lower abuse profile distinguish it from existing alternatives in its therapeutic class.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
DrugBank database, PubMed literature review, FDA prescribing information, and peer-reviewed pharmacological studies were consulted. Additional sources included clinical trial data and neuropharmacological literature on monoamine transporter systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
The medication shows clear structural relationships to naturally occurring amino acids and neurotransmitters. Its mechanism works entirely through endogenous neurotransmitter systems without artificial stimulation. Clinical efficacy is well-documented with a favorable safety profile compared to traditional stimulants. The compound's selective action on evolutionarily conserved transporter systems demonstrates integration with natural neurophysiology.<br>
</p>
