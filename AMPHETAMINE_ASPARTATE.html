# Naturopathic Formulary Medication Evaluation Protocol<br>
# Objective: Comprehensive assessment of natural derivation and therapeutic alignment<br>
</p>
<p>
For <strong>AMPHETAMINE ASPARTATE</strong>:<br>
</p>
<p>
## 1. NATURAL DERIVATION ASSESSMENT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Source Investigation<br>
Amphetamine aspartate is a synthetic compound that combines racemic amphetamine with aspartic acid. The amphetamine component was historically first isolated from the natural plant Ephedra sinica (ma huang) through chemical modification of ephedrine, a naturally occurring alkaloid. However, modern pharmaceutical amphetamine is produced entirely through synthetic methods. Aspartic acid is a naturally occurring amino acid found in all living organisms and is one of the 20 standard amino acids used in protein synthesis.<br>
</p>
<p>
Traditional medicine systems, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine, have used Ephedra species for over 4,000 years for respiratory conditions and energy enhancement, though the specific amphetamine compounds were not isolated until the 1920s.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Structural Analysis<br>
Amphetamine (alpha-methylphenethylamine) shares structural similarity with naturally occurring phenethylamine compounds found in various plants and produced endogenously in humans. The core phenethylamine structure is present in numerous natural compounds including dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The aspartate component is identical to the naturally occurring amino acid L-aspartic acid, which plays essential roles in neurotransmitter synthesis and the urea cycle.<br>
</p>
<p>
The compound's structure closely resembles endogenous catecholamine neurotransmitters, differing primarily in the addition of a methyl group on the alpha carbon.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Biological Mechanism Evaluation<br>
Amphetamine aspartate acts primarily through interaction with endogenous neurotransmitter systems, specifically blocking reuptake and promoting release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent, serotonin. These mechanisms directly interface with naturally occurring neurotransmitter pathways that regulate attention, arousal, and executive function.<br>
</p>
<p>
The medication targets the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), which are evolutionarily conserved proteins essential for neurotransmitter homeostasis.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Natural System Integration (Expanded Assessment)<br>
Amphetamine aspartate targets naturally occurring transporters and receptors within the central nervous system's reward and attention pathways. It works within the evolutionarily conserved monoaminergic systems that regulate arousal, motivation, and cognitive function. The medication can restore functional balance in individuals with dopaminergic and noradrenergic dysregulation, particularly in ADHD where these systems show documented dysfunction.<br>
</p>
<p>
The compound enables endogenous neurotransmitter systems to function more effectively by increasing synaptic availability of naturally produced dopamine and norepinephrine. It can prevent the need for more invasive interventions in attention disorders and facilitate improved cognitive and behavioral function.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 2. THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Mechanism of Action<br>
Amphetamine aspartate functions as a central nervous system stimulant by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine while also promoting their release from presynaptic terminals. It reverses the direction of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, leading to increased extracellular concentrations of these neurotransmitters in key brain regions including the prefrontal cortex and striatum.<br>
</p>
<p>
The aspartate component serves as a delivery mechanism and may contribute to improved bioavailability while providing the naturally occurring amino acid for metabolic processes.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Clinical Utility<br>
Primary therapeutic applications include treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. The medication is typically used as part of comprehensive treatment programs that include psychological, educational, and social measures. Safety profile shows generally good tolerability when used appropriately, with common side effects including decreased appetite, insomnia, and mood changes.<br>
</p>
<p>
The medication is typically prescribed for long-term management but can be periodically discontinued to assess ongoing need.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Integration Potential<br>
Amphetamine aspartate can be integrated with behavioral interventions, dietary modifications, and lifestyle counseling. It may create a therapeutic window that allows for implementation of behavioral and cognitive strategies. Practitioners require thorough understanding of stimulant pharmacology and monitoring protocols.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 3. REGULATORY AND PRECEDENT CONTEXT<br>
</p>
<p>
### Current Status<br>
Amphetamine aspartate is FDA-approved and classified as a Schedule II controlled substance due to its potential for abuse and dependence. It is approved for ADHD in patients 3 years and older and for narcolepsy in patients 6 years and older.<br>
</p>
<p>
The medication is included in standard psychiatric and pediatric formularies and is considered a first-line treatment for ADHD by major medical organizations.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Comparable Medications<br>
Other stimulant medications including methylphenidate are commonly used in various medical formularies. The amphetamine class has precedent in medical practice, and several amphetamine-based medications are considered essential treatments for attention disorders.<br>
</p>
<p>
## 4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION<br>
</p>
<p>
### Primary Sources Consulted<br>
Extensive literature review conducted through PubMed, DrugBank, FDA prescribing information, and peer-reviewed pharmacological texts. Evidence gathered from neurochemistry research, clinical trials, and pharmacokinetic studies.<br>
</p>
<p>
### Key Findings<br>
Natural derivation evidence includes structural relationship to naturally occurring phenethylamines and catecholamines, with aspartic acid being a naturally occurring amino acid. Mechanism targets evolutionarily conserved neurotransmitter systems with established roles in cognitive function and arousal regulation.<br>
</p>
<p>

<strong>Natural Derivation Assessment:</strong><br>
Amphetamine aspartate demonstrates multiple natural connections. The aspartic acid component is a naturally occurring amino acid essential for human metabolism. The amphetamine portion, while synthetic, is structurally analogous to naturally occurring phenethylamine compounds and endogenous catecholamine neurotransmitters. Historical derivation traces to natural ephedrine alkaloids from Ephedra species.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Structural/Functional Relationships:</strong><br>
The compound shares core structural features with dopamine, norepinephrine, and other naturally occurring phenethylamine derivatives. The phenethylamine backbone is ubiquitous in natural systems, and the specific structural modifications enhance selectivity for endogenous neurotransmitter transporters.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Biological Integration:</strong><br>
The medication integrates directly with naturally occurring dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. It targets evolutionarily conserved transporter proteins (DAT, NET) and works within established neural circuits that regulate attention, arousal, and executive function. The mechanism enhances naturally occurring neurotransmitter signaling rather than introducing foreign pharmacological activity.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Natural System Interface:</strong><br>
